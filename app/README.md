# Application Directory

This directory, `app/`, is intended to hold specific components, configurations, or modules related to the Listify application.

## Purpose

The structure and content of this directory can be defined as the project evolves. It might include:
- Feature-specific modules
- Application-level configuration files
- Assets or resources grouped by application context

## Main Application Code

The core Flutter source code for the Listify application is currently located in the `../code` directory. Please refer to `../code/README.md` for details about building and running the main application.

## How to Use This Directory

As the project grows, you can organize relevant files here. For example:

```
/app
  ├── README.md
  ├── features/
  │   └── new_feature_module/
  └── configs/
      └── app_settings.json
```

This setup helps in organizing application-related files separately from the core codebase if needed.
